            <h3>As requested by many students, in order to be coherent with other courses which have concluded the classes, next week (the last one) the classes will be exclusively ASYNC. This means that videos will be published with the last classes, and you do not need to come in the room. This is true both for Mon. 16 and Tue. 17.
                In a few hours the exact list of videos substituting the in-presence classes will be published. Also detailed instructions for the projects will be published, and a registration form.
                Not having more opportunities to meet each others personally, best wishes for the Holiday Season !! </h3>
