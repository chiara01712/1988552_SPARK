This means that videos will be published with the last classes, and you do not need to come in the room. This is true both for Mon. 16 and Tue. 17.
                In a few hours the exact list of videos substituting the in-presence classes will be published. Also detailed instructions for the projects will be published, and a registration form.
                Not having more opportunities to meet each others personally, best wishes for the Holiday Season !! </h3>
